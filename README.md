  <b style=text-align:center;font-family:Roboto>Just a little mobile math game ready to try <a target="_blank" href='https://essingen123.github.io/mg'>here</a></b><br /> and hey, don't miss out on the sound experience 🔊😀👍 
  
App runs best on an iPhone ~ when added to home screen as a PWA (even though general android/chrome has an open API to physical feedback that's slightly used) - although there's some code for it to work quite well in a semi-fullscreen via a browser too, activated via a scroll, or orientation change. Code is intentionally less filled with ES6 to work on older devices such as an iPad 2. Yet no adaption to lower FPS rates for better performance. Still a work in progress.
