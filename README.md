Yadda
App runs best on an iPhone ~ when added to home screen as a PWA (even though general android/chrome has an open API to physical feedback that's slightly used) - although there's some code for it to work quite well in a semi-fullscreen via a browser too, activated via a scroll, or orientation change. Code is intentionally less filled with ES6 to work on older devices such as an iPad 2. Yet no adaption to lower FPS rates for better performance. Still a work in progress.
